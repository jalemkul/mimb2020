================================
Equilibration of WALP23 in POPC
================================

Membrane systems can be very sensitive in the initial stages of equilibration, so provided here is
an example of a two-stage equilibration, run with a short time step initially, then with a normal
time step.

Use NAMD to run equil0.in first, then equil.in as normal.
